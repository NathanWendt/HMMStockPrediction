# HMMStockPrediction

A class for a HMM stock predictor is created. The transition matrix (A), emission matrix(B), and initial distribution (pi) are trained via 
expectation maximization (EM). Predictions are made by maximum likelihood from the trained HMM model. Daily close values are predicted from
known daily opens.

hmmlearn package is used for model and training
